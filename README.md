Demos of Pixel rendering in Razor Components

There are three demos:
- Cascading pixels, rendered by the server positioning each pixel 
- CSS Cascading pixels, rendered by CSS keyframe animation
- Image Loader - Load an image of your choice, which is then pixellated, randomised and animated into view.

You can try it out as a Razor Components build here
