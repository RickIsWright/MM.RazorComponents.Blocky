Demos of Pixel rendering in Razor Components

There are three demos:
- Pixellated Image Scaling - Loads an image from the server and renders it in a CSS grid, which can be scaled.
- Cascading pixels, rendered by the server positioning each pixel 
- Image Loader - Load an image of your choice (smaller than about 27KB to avoid crashes in SignalR/Razor Components), which is then pixellated, randomised and animated into view.
